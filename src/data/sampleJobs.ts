- Travel & logistics: coordinate multi-city domestic and international travel, lodging, private transport, and contingency plans.
- Meeting facilitation: capture crisp action items in leadership syncs and hold stakeholders accountable.
- Leverage modern AI tools (Gemini, Claude, Zapier) to automate daily administrative bottlenecks.

Qualifications & Experience:
- 4+ years of experience as an Executive Assistant supporting C-suite or startup founders in a fast-paced or remote environment.
- Mastery of Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, and modern scheduling tools.
- Demonstrated experience building or using AI automation tools (Zapier, LLM prompts) to increase personal leverage.
